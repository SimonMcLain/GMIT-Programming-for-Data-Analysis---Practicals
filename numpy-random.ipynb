    "numpy.random is a routine docstring in the NumPy package for the generation of pseudorandom numbers. The generation of pseudorandom numbers is based on the Mersenne Twister: a 623-dimensionally equidistributed uniform pseudorandom number generator. The Mersenne Twister was first proposed in 1998 by Makato Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura of Keio University to solve the problem of generating 'high-quality' random numbers with computers."
