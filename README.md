## Assignment 2018

### last commit on or before November 11th, 2018

#### Problem Statement

This assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. Students are required to create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least fie of the distributions provided for in the package.

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in the Jupyter notebook.

##### Task 1
Explain the overall purpose of the package.

##### Task 2
Explain the use of the "Simple random data" and "Permutations" functions.

##### Task 3
Explain the use an purpose of at least five "Distributions" functions.

##### Task 4
Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.


#### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Create a GitHub account and clone or copy the repository. Public access has been granted to the repository and is available for use under the terms of the APACHE licence. 

Link: https://github.com/SimonMcLain/GMIT-Programming-for-Data-Analysis---Practicals.git

To run the file open it in Juypter notebook, with is included in the anaconda download. See Prerequsites below. 

On the command line access the repository on your local machine, run Juypter notebook and open the file named numpy-random.ipynb.

Once the file is open in Jupyter notebook on the ribbon click on Kernal, then restart and run all. The charts and descriptive statistics will be displayed.


#### Prerequisites

Your will require Python to be loaded on your local machine. I recommend downloading and installing Anaconda.
